## The Backstreet Boys

This project is an overview on The Backstreet Boys; their meteoric rise to fame, their slight fall, as well as their return to the spotlight. It shows the link to buy the Backstreet Boys' official merch on the front page as this website is meant to help market the Backstreet Boys and help them gain revenue. There is even a short quiz at the end for them to test what knowledge they had gained throughout their exploration of the website.

### Design Process

The website is for those interested to know more about bands such as the Backstreet Boys as they can get a deeper understanding of what the band went through in order to gain the fame they did and how they retained said fame. After learning more, they can complete a quiz as well as purchase official Backstreet Boys merchandise through the link embedded in the Home page. The website provides them with many different types of information regarding the band, so that they can learn much about the Backstreet Boys.

#### User Stories

As an external user, I wish to learn more about the Backstreet Boys' history and the members.
As an external user, I wish to be able to find a location to purchase merchandise of the Backstreet Boys.
As the site owner, I wish to enable users to view the merchandise store to increase my sales.

#### Wireframe

The wireframe is included in the repository and the folder as the only XD file.

### Features

#### Exisitng Features

###### 4 Working pages with videos showcasing famous songs of the band as well as loaded with information regarding the band itself.

###### A quiz regarding the content of the website that can calculate the score of the user and give some words of encouragement

###### A working link to the ACTUAL merchandise shop of the Backstreet Boys

#### Feature to implement

I could possibly implement a way to check the traffic that the site directs people to the merchandise store so the site owner can see how effective the site is at getting traffic.

### Technologies Used

###### HTML as my main language to code the site

###### CSS to style the site

###### JavaScript for the simple quiz at the end.

### Testing

1. The Quiz - I took a large amount of time to do the quiz as it required me to make sure that all the inputs were correct and to make sure that whatever I added is in the content of the site if not it should not be tested. It took me quite awhile to figure out how to add the correct answers, so I ended up on youtube looking for a tutorial to help me better understand what needed to be done and I did it. When the person gets a score below 3, the output is different from if they get a score of 4 or 5, what I was aiming for.
2. The Videos in the Site - This was the most problematic for me as it kept producing an error saying that the video is not playable no matter how i adjusted the code. After much research on multiple forums, I found out that it was an issue in the owners applying more copyright features so the video cannot be embedded. Hence, I had to change the videos and they are accredited below.
3. The different screens - I made most of my code friendly for all screen sizes and the main thing I had to change was the heading of the sites as the underline and overline features hindered each other on the smaller screens so they had to be adjusted. Apart from that, my site was friendly on other screens as well.

#### Acknowledgements

I went to look through websites on various bands such as N-Sync, Maroon 5 as well as Backstreet Boys to find out what websites like these have.
By doing so, I know what pages to have and I placed the previous notable events in my file through this research.
I used various sites as well as my own knowledge in order to create the content for all the pages as I wanted my facts to be correct.
