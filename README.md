## The Backstreet Boys

This project is an overview on The Backstreet Boys; their meteoric rise to fame, their slight fall, as well as their return to the spotlight. It shows the link to buy the Backstreet Boys' official merch on the front page as this website is meant to help market the Backstreet Boys and help them gain revenue. There is even a short quiz at the end for them to test what knowledge they had gained throughout their exploration of the website.

### Design Process

### Research Done

I went to look through websites on various bands such as N-Sync, Maroon 5 as well as Backstreet Boys to find out what websites like these have.
By doing so, I know what pages to have and I placed the previous notable events in my file through this research.
I used various sites as well as my own knowledge in order to create the content for all the pages as I wanted my facts to be correct.
